# Tess' Corner – MVP Website

**Your one-stop shop for everyday wear!**

Tess' Corner is a minimal, elegant, and mobile-friendly e-commerce MVP built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The platform allows customers to browse various product categories, add items to a cart, view a total cost, and then proceed to pick up their orders at the physical shop location.

> 🎁 This is a surprise MVP project for Tess, a passionate entrepreneur based in Mawanga, Nakuru.
